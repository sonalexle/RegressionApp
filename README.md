# RegressionApp

A project for the course CS-A2120 Programming Studio 2: Project at Aalto University.

A Scala app that fits linear regression and quadratic regression models to a dataset and visualizes the fit along with the data points. Simple metrics such as coefficient of determination are also displayed. The app can fit the models to datasets with hundreds of millions of data points in only a few minutes.

## Usage:

Clone the repository and open the project in Intellij IDEA with the Scala plug-in installed. 
The program is started by right-clicking on `RegressionApp` located in `src/main/scala/regressionGui/RegressionApp` and 
choose `Run "RegressionApp"`. The program was built with Scala sbt. 

Alternatively, navigate to `out/artifacts/RegressionApp_jar/` and run `RegressionApp.jar`. 
The only requirement for this option is that one's PC has the Java Runtime Environment or that one knows how to run .jar files. 

Below is a picture showcasing the GUI of the application.
